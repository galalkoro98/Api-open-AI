# node-js-with-open-AI

## few step to start 

- colne this [repo](https://github.com/galalkoro98/chat-GPT-AI-with-node-js.git)
- After clone install `Node.js` on your machine. You can download the appropriate version for your operating system from the official `Node.js` website.
- Create a new `Node.js` project by running `npm init` in an empty directory. This will create a `package.json` file, which is used to manage dependencies and scripts for your project.
- Install the OpenAI `Node.js` package by running npm install` openai.`
- Once the package is installed, you can use it to interact with the OpenAI API in your `Node.js` code. Here is an example of how you might use the package to generate text using the GPT-3 engine:

<code>
 const openai = require('openai');

openai.apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";

const prompt = "What is the capital of France?";

openai.completions
  .create({
    engine: "text-davinci-002",
    prompt: prompt,
    maxTokens:1024
  })
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.choices[0].text);
  });
  </code>

- Replace the `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own **OpenAI** API key, and run the script by executing node script.js in terminal.
- This script will print out the capital of France. you can use this script in your `node.js` server and route it to an endpoint of your choice.
- You can use web framework like `expressJS` to create RESTful endpoints and use these endpoints to post the data to your **GPT-3** script. And return the response to your frontend.

`Note`

Please note that you will need to have an API Key and enough quota to use the GPT-3 Model, and make sure the prompt you are passing is properly formated according to the GPT-3 input format
